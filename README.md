This DEX Frontend was built as part of the course "Javascript for Blockchain Developers"at Moralis Academy.
It was built using the Coinpaprika API for getting data on the top ranked coins.

Furthermore, druing the first version, we made use of the servers provided by Moralis aswell as a Plug in for a Fiat onramp and the Plug in for the 1inch API to perform swaps.

As Moralis Server V1 is now deprecated I reworked this project. Now it shows the top coins and also gives you the ability to get quotes on the exchange rates between tokens. 
It also features a MetaMask login, but there is no further Web3 functionality added currently.
